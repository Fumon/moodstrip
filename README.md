A couple simple scripts to control the leds I installed for mood lighting in my room.

Presently, the LED strip is a 2m~ 92 LEDs long strip of LPD8806 LEDs and shift-register-like drivers. Oriignal source: [Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/product/306)

They are driven by a [teensyduino 3.1](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensy31.html) attached to a small openwrt router with a socat serial bridge on it. It's powered by a 5v 2amp power brick.

###Future Directions

- Put the whole control mess in an actual project box.
- Optimize the serial bridge.
- Write a pleasing webapp for control.
- Use LEDs for gradual sun-lamp like wakeup in winter months.
